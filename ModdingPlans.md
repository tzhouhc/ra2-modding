# Modding Plans

## Interesting Technology

The following parts of Ares are interesting and I would like to use them in my mod.

### Additional Armor Types

### Attach Effect

### Bounty
Earn bounty for killing off enemy precious units, like heroes, carriers, dreadnaughts, kirovs, super weapons, etc.

### Crush Damage
Otherwise battle fortress is kinda op.

### Veterancy Insignia
I like what I did before!

### Initial Payload
Some vehicles comes with bonus units.

### NoAmmoWeapon
Some units can carry a few more powerful warheads and then revert to more mundane stuff if used up.
* Grenadiers, RPG infantry

### Specific Passengers
Not sure what yet.

### Various prerequisites

### Self Heal

### Survivors

### Academies

### Custom Building Foundations

# Tools
This is a little topic to point you to some C&C modding tools.

* [XCC Utilities](http://xhp.xwis.net): This package of tools made by Olaf van der Spek is essential to everyone who wants to mod a C&C game.

* [OS SHP Builder](http://www.ppmsite.com/?go=shpbuilderinfo): This tool created by Banshee and other people from PPM, is a tool used to create shp files, these files are used as units and buildings in all C&C games from C&C1 to RA2.

* Voxel Section Editor III: This is another tool created by Banshee and other people from PPM, this is a tool to create voxels, voxels are used mostly as tanks in TS and RA2 however the Mammoth Mark 2 is also a voxel.
